# Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in various sizes.

For now, placeholder icons are used. Replace these with proper icon designs:

- icon16.png (16x16) - Toolbar icon
- icon48.png (48x48) - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128) - Chrome Web Store

Icon should represent focus/attention (e.g., target, brain, eye, etc.)
